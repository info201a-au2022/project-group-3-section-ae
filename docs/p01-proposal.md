### Autumn 2022

## **_Abstract_**  
Our main question is which countries have the best living conditions for its citizens. This question is important because it highlights which countries have the best and affordable services offered to its people. To address this question we will focus on three main areas: crime rates, cost of living and healthcare affordability.

## **_Keywords_**  
Quality of Life; Crime Index; Cost of Living; Healthcare Affordability

## **_Introduction_**  
Nowadays, quality of life has become a major concern for all of us and a low quality of life prevents us from being comfortable and secure in our own environment. In today’s society, large numbers of people are extremely worried about their families’ well-being, constantly concerned about people around them, or experiencing financial difficulties. By facilitating conditions that ensure a higher quality of life, individuals will feel happier and more secure. Our group decided to focus on three main aspects of the quality of life: crime rates, cost of living, and healthcare that helps us in determining which country is the safest to live in. Below are datasets that look at various aspects of a meaningful life. Examining these sets of data will help and give us a clarified comprehension of which nations have the best quality of life.

## **_Problem Domain_**
### Background  
Finding the best quality of life in a certain country means analyzing and finding information on different aspects. The three main aspects we have chosen to focus on are crime rate, cost of living, and healthcare. These are some main topics that affect an individual's quality of life and will be the main focus when finding the best countries.

### Direct Stakeholders
Some direct stakeholders that are involved in the research of this topic are the individuals in each country and are impacted by crime rate, cost of living, and healthcare. These are things that affect someone living in a country and overall impact their decisions and their community. They are directly affected if there are high crime rates resulting in an unsafe environment, and they are also adding risk. In addition, the cost of living can typically be harmful to the individual if it's high, as it is harder to buy living necessities like food, water, and shelter. Lower cost of living areas tend to be better for people as they can pay for their needs but also have some extra money to use on other activities. Lastly, healthcare and accessibility in an area plays a big role in the community as it has the potential to make individuals feel valued and taken care of with healthcare aids.

### Indirect Stakeholders
Some indirect stakeholders that are involved are the governments of each given country. In addition with high crime rates, cost of living and bad healthcare, more citizens are frustrated and they are the ones who need to figure out a way to establish better systems. If the people aren't happy the government is in charge to take care of them and create a working atmosphere.

### Human Values  
In addition, some human values consist of accessibility, safety, fun, and valued citizens in a certain country. These qualities all makeup what a good quality of life encompasses and what humans value when they move to a new place. Someone should feel as though they can live comfortably without worrying about things that are unintentionally harmful to them. Having accessible help, food, healthcare, and activities allows people to have fun and not have underlying stress about things they cannot control.

### Potential Benefits  
Some potential benefits of this are creating an atmosphere where people have the best conditions and can live their lives to the fullest . It will create a strong community within each country and increase human population, and accessibility which is an enormous aspect of living. More people will be attended to if they are sick and have a better chance of surviving disease. In addition, the economy will increase and more will feel inclined to come live in that area.

### Potential Harms
Lastly, some potential harm could be a country’s image, economy, and population. If the crime rates are really bad in an area and are broadcasted to the world many will assume that it is an unsafe area and won’t think about coming to live there. Not only does this scare others away but it affects the job market for people, and in the long term affects the economy of the country. All these aspects depend on each other and are affected when one thing goes wrong.

## **_Research Questions_**   
Research Q1 (Crime Rates):Which countries offer the best security for its people?
Research Q2: (Cost of Living): Which countries have the most affordable cost of living?
Research Q3: (Healthcare): Which countries have the most viable healthcare?

1) Crime rates are important because it enables us to determine if we are safe in our surroundings and should be considered while choosing which country to live in. Based on the rate in your country, this means higher crime rates equal to higher chances of extra care. If the statistics are low for a particular country, then there’s a need for less assistance. This research aspect impacts how we live life and motivates us to stay safe.
2) Cost of living is another main issue we all think of these days. The ranking of the countries is a good indicator of where we should live and how we can live life financially. This is especially important because everyone needs to know how they spend their finances daily.  This eventually could have a major impact on our emotions and happiness. Depending on higher rankings, this would motivate yourself to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the future.
3) Healthcare is an essential preventative mechanism for reducing illness and the severity of illness financially across populations. Increased healthcare aids in the improvement and enjoyment of our lives. Without great services around the world, we wouldn’t have been able to live with the choices we have. In general, healthcare motivates us to live a longer life in the healthiest way possible.

## **_Datasets_**
*Dataset 1: Crime Rates*  
The crime rates dataset relates to our problem domain as it is one of the specific factors we decided to analyze when it comes to the quality of life in a specific country.  The crime rates dataset includes data on the crime index for each country as well as that country's safety index. This dataset will help answer the research question about which country has the safest environment in regards to criminal activity.

*Dataset 2: Cost of Living:*  
The cost of living dataset relates to our problem domain as it's another one of the factors that we are analyzing to determine the quality of life in each country. The cost of living datasets are based off of New York City's cost of living. It will help answer the research question which country has the most affordable living environment

*Dataset 3: Healthcare Index:*  
The healthcare dataset relates to our problem domain as it examines the healthcare aspect of the quality of life in a country. The dataset ranks each country on its healthcare index. This dataset will help answer which country is able to provide the best healthcare to its citizens by analyzing the healthcare indexes.

*Dataset 4: Healthcare Expenditure:*  
The healthcare expenditures relate to our problem domain because it helps answer the question which country has the most affordable healthcare. This dataset shows how much out of pocket expenditure for healthcare occurs in each country. The dataset and the healthcare index dataset together will help answer the question which countries have the most viable healthcare based on quality service and price.
