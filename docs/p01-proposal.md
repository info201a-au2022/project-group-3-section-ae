## **_Introduction_**  
Nowadays, quality of life has become a major concern for all of us and a low quality of life prevents us from being comfortable and secure in our own environment. In today’s society, large numbers of people are extremely worried about their families’ well-being, constantly concerned about people around them, or experiencing financial difficulties. By facilitating conditions that ensure a higher quality of life, individuals will feel happier and more secure. Our group decided to focus on three main aspects of the quality of life: crime rates, cost of living, and healthcare that helps us in determining which country is the safest to live in. Below are datasets that look at various aspects of a meaningful life. Examining these sets of data will help and give us a clarified comprehension of which nations have the best quality of life.

## **_Problem Domain_**
### Background  
Finding the best quality of life in a certain country means analyzing and finding information on different aspects. The three main aspects we have chosen to focus on are crime rate, cost of living, and healthcare. These are some main topics that affect an individual's quality of life and will be the main focus when finding the best countries.

### Direct Stakeholders
Some direct stakeholders that are involved in the research of this topic are the individuals in each country and are impacted by crime rate, cost of living, and healthcare. These are things that affect someone living in a country and overall impact their decisions and their community. They are directly affected if there are high crime rates resulting in an unsafe environment, and they are also adding risk. In addition, the cost of living can typically be harmful to the individual if it's high, as it is harder to buy living necessities like food, water, and shelter. Lower cost of living areas tend to be better for people as they can pay for their needs but also have some extra money to use on other activities. Lastly, healthcare and accessibility in an area plays a big role in the community as it has the potential to make individuals feel valued and taken care of with healthcare aids.

### Indirect Stakeholders
Some indirect stakeholders that are involved are the governments of each given country. In addition with high crime rates, cost of living and bad healthcare, more citizens are frustrated and they are the ones who need to figure out a way to establish better systems. If the people aren't happy the government is in charge to take care of them and create a working atmosphere.
