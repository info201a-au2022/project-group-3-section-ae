##**_Introduction_**  
Nowadays, quality of life has become a major concern for all of us and a low quality of life prevents us from being comfortable and secure in our own environment. In today’s society, large numbers of people are extremely worried about their families’ well-being, constantly concerned about people around them, or experiencing financial difficulties. By facilitating conditions that ensure a higher quality of life, individuals will feel happier and more secure. Our group decided to focus on three main aspects of the quality of life: crime rates, cost of living, and healthcare that helps us in determining which country is the safest to live in. Below are datasets that look at various aspects of a meaningful life. Examining these sets of data will help and give us a clarified comprehension of which nations have the best quality of life.
